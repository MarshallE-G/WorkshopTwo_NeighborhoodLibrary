# Workshop 2: Neighborhood Library
- For this project, I created a library's book inventory that holds 20 books, and a user interface menu that allows for viewing all available books and checked out books. As well as giving the user the option to check out a book or check in a book.

## Interesting Code
- One interesting piece of code was:

        // userName = scanner.next();

- Why?
  - Because when I initially used "scanner.nextLine()", the line would be "skipped" for some reason.
